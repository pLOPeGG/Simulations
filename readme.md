# Simulations

This repository contains some simulations done in Julia with nice animations.

## Ball in circle
A few ball are dropped inside a circle with almost identical initial positions and velocities. The simulation show the quick divergence of trajectories. Example code include DifferentialEquations and Unitful packages as a nice demonstration of interoperability.
This is a nice example of chaos emerging from simple setup.
